Wondering why branch named `main` instead of `master` ? Reason is after the following tweet from github ceo https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1271253144442253312 i am trying to use less racially charged words. Not that this will resolve every problem related to racial injustice,  However i believe it's always good to have the know-how and the tools to be able to change the names we use. That goes for branch names as well. :)
